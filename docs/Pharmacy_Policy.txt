Welcome to Our Online Pharmacy
A simple, affordable way to get the medications you need—without insurance.
Thank you for choosing our pharmacy! We’re committed to making your medication experience clear, transparent, and stress-free. This guide walks you through our policies, how to get started as a new customer, and how to seamlessly manage your prescriptions.

How Our Pharmacy Works
We operate on a cash-pay model—meaning we do not process insurance. Instead, we offer straightforward, low-margin pricing on medications. No hidden fees. No surprise charges. No insurance headaches.
Whether you’re transferring an existing prescription or starting a new one, we’re here to make things easy.

Getting Started as a New Customer
1. Create Your Account
Simply visit our website and select “Create Account.”
You’ll be asked for:
    • Your basic contact information
    • A secure password
    • Your preferred shipping address
    • Optional: a secondary contact method for delivery updates
Once your account is created, you can view your medication list, track orders, and manage refill reminders.
2. Add Your Billing Information
Because we don’t work with insurance, you can pay using:
    • Credit or debit cards
    • HSA/FSA cards (for most medications)
    • Any additional payment methods listed at checkout
We only charge you when a prescription is confirmed and ready for shipment.

Adding Prescriptions
There are three easy ways to get prescriptions into our system:
Option A: Ask Your Doctor to Send It Directly
Your provider can e-prescribe your medication to us.
Just have them send it to:
Open Access RX
NCPDP/NPI: 0123456789
Address: 123 Fake St Nowheresburg,NE
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Fax: (555) 000-1111
This is usually the fastest and most reliable method.

Option B: Transfer an Existing Prescription
Already have a prescription at another pharmacy?
No problem—just fill out our “Transfer Prescription” form online.
We’ll contact your previous pharmacy and handle everything behind the scenes.

Option C: Upload Your Prescription
If your provider gave you a paper prescription:
    1. Log in to your account
    2. Go to “Upload Prescription”
    3. Take a clear photo or scan
    4. Submit it for verification
A pharmacist will review it and notify you once it’s approved.

Delivery & Shipping Policies
Processing Time
Most orders are processed and verified by a pharmacist within 1–2 business days.
Controlled substances or specialty medications may require additional verification time.
Delivery Speed
Once shipped, typical delivery times are:
    • Standard shipping: 3–5 business days
    • Expedited shipping: 1–2 business days (additional fee)
You’ll receive tracking information as soon as your order leaves our facility.
Shipping Restrictions
We currently ship only within the United States and cannot deliver to P.O. boxes for certain medications due to federal regulations.

Cancellation & Return Policies
Order Cancellation
You may cancel an order any time before it ships.
To cancel:
    • Log in → go to “Orders” → select “Cancel Order”
or
    • Contact our customer support team by phone or chat
Once an order has shipped, it can no longer be canceled.
Return Policy (Important!)
Because medications cannot be reused or resold once dispensed, we cannot accept returns—even if the package is unopened.
If there was an issue with your order (wrong medication, damaged shipment, etc.), please contact us immediately. We will make it right.

Refill Management
We offer multiple ways to stay on top of your medications:
    • Refill reminders: Get notified when it’s time to reorder
    • Auto-refill: Select eligible medications to be automatically prepared and shipped
    • Dashboard tracking: View all upcoming, active, and previous orders
If your prescription has expired or runs out of refills, we’ll alert you and help coordinate with your provider.
